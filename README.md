# odin-recipes
First foundations project. Working on refreshing basic WebDev fundamentals.

This is an exercise wherein I will create a simple recipe-book style website to practice
file-structures, linking, and to remember some HTML boilerplate.  Also learning git, WOO HOO!

For now, the project is completed to the assignment specifications. I plan on revisiting this once
I have more practice with CSS. The main focus of this project was to rebuild familiarity with 
HTML and writing boilerplate.
